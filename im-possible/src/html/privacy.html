collect when you use and visit the Site, and how we 
safeguard your information.  We never sell your personal information to third parties.

<h2>Personal information</h2>

<p>
As the Site uses Google Infrastructure to work,
we use Google authentication mechanisms.
So, we know visitor's nickname and email only.
We don't know password to your Google account,
because you log in via Google authenication form.

The information in the log files include  your IP (internet protocol) address, 
your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL), the browser you used to 
visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you

<h2>
Cookies and Web Beacons
</h2>

<p>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal

<p>
We also use third party advertisements on the Site to support our site.  
Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web 
beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send 
these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) 
information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used 
to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  
This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York 
real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing 
certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking 
ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
<p>

<p>
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
Google's use of the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx">DART cookie</a>

cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such

interact with our site as well as other websites.  This could include the 
inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
</p>

<p>
Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of 
any advertising program.  Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, 
the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
